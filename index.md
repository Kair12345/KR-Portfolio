### Space Game 
* OOP solution for a collision based 2d space shooter. 
* Screen Capture of Running Application 
* ![SpaceGame](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/Images/SpaceGameSC.png?raw=true)
* [Source Code for Application](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/src/SpaceGame%20text.txt)
* Game Description: 
This game is a one direction shooter with the objective being to destroy astroids before they reach the bottom of the screen. Backgrounds include stars apearing in patterns programmed to move across the screen. I also (with permission) used someone elses code for a "timer" class so I could control how often astroids would show up. A "laser" class was also including allowing the ship, which is under the players control, to shoot and eventually destroy astroids. The game keeps track and diplays various values like "ship health" (which goes down when the ship comes in contact with astroids) and "score" (which keeps track of how many astroids reach the bottom of the screen) bot values can cause the player to lose the game.  

### Calculator 
OOP solution for calculator with basic math operater functions.   
* Screen Capture of Running Application 
* ![Calculator](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/Images/CalculatorSC.png?raw=true)
* [Source Code for Application](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/src/Calculator%20text.txt)
* Game Description: 
This program is a replica of a normal calculator with a number buttons and basic number operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator also has other fuctions like tangent, plus-minus, Pi, and percents. If enough number buttons are clicked and show up on the screen the numbers will shrink to fit the screen. 

### Pig Latin Convertor 
OOP solution for a application with basic language translation functions 
* Screen Capture of Running Application 
* ![Pig Latin Convertor](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/Images/PigLanguageSC.png?raw=true) 
* [Source Code for Application](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/src/PigLatin%20text.txt) 
* Game Description: 
This application will take any combinations of letters and change it into basic Pig Latin by switching the placement of some consonants and vowels and adding "ay." Solme limits of this application is it does not contain the code necassary to convert more then one word at a time without re-running the program. For example, entering the word "hello" into the program and clicking enter will cause the program to change the word to "ellohay." 

### Shape Creater 
OOP solution for a shape volume and area calculator 
* Screen Capture of Running Application 
* ![Shape Creater](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/Images/ShapeTestSC.png?raw=true) 
* [Source Code for Application](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/src/ShapeTest%20text.txt) 
* Game Description: 
This application with tell you the volume and surface area of any block, pyrimid, or sphere that you enter values for. The program with follow the order of block, sphere, pyrimid, when asking for values. The applications calculations in the code seem to me to be accurate for everything with blocks and spheres but might be slightly incorrect while calculating pyrimid surface area. 

### Group 2048 Project 
OOP solution for a incomplete 2048 clone  
* Screen Capture of Running Application 
* ![Group 2048 Project](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/Images/GroupBlockSC.png?raw=true) 
* [Source Code for Application](https://github.com/Kair12345/KR-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/src/GroupGame%20text.txt) 
* Game Description: 
Unfortunately this project is still unfinished and does not contain the correct collision detection or block multiplication. That said it still has similar block movement, p-lay screen, and has graphics and sounds implimented. So far the game has two blocks with complete movement capiblities in four directions. These blocks are assigned to different keys so two different people can use one keybourd to control seperate blocks.
